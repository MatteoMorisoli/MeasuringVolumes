# MeasuringVolumes
USI/INF Bachelor project

This is the program I built as part of my Bachelor project to simulate the process of creating a volume approximation of a triangle mesh using a close packing of spheres.

## Installing and Running the program

Step 1: Install GLFW on your machine : http://www.glfw.org/

Step 2: Download the project and open it in Xcode using the xcodeproj file.

Step 3: Make sure that under "Build Phases" you link the GLFW library installation on your machine to the project.

Step 4: Open the App.cpp file and change the paths to reflect the one on your machine where indicated.

Step 5: Build and run.

Step 6: select settings on the menu and press run to start simulation (Be advised, Grid size should be left at 3.0 for the examples contained in the program).
